This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on several medical and lifestyle factors using the Heart Disease dataset.The dataset contains information about patients who were evaluated for heart disease.The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict heart disease and help healthcare professionals diagnose and treat patients more effectively.

### Data
The Heart Disease dataset used in this project contains 303 observations and 14 variables. The variables include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, slope, number of major vessels, thal, and the target variable, which is the presence of heart disease.

### conclusion
The machine learning model developed in this project can accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease based on several medical and lifestyle factors using the Heart Disease dataset.
